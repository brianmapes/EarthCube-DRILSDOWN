        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions<br>
        </h2>
      </div>
      <h4 align="left">1. What's the vision? <br>
      </h4>
      <p align="left">The idea of <i>visualization for algorithm design
          (VisAD) </i>is that human-data interaction in a Graphical
        User Interface (GUI) can be a valuable source of insight for the
        quest to objectively measure important space-time processes,
        relationships, and entities. <br>
      </p>
      <div align="left">DRILSDOWN aims to link a powerful free GUI (The
        IDV, embodying the VisAD idea) to a popular coding space
        (JuPyter notebooks and&nbsp; iPython), for big data in geospace
        (including the atmosphere and ocean where the time domain is
        also big and highly structured).<br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <h4 align="left">2. Who is DRILSDOWN intended for? <br>
      </h4>
      <p align="left">Researchers and students seeking to extract
        meaning from big geospatial datasets, including multiple and
        distributed datasets.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 align="left">3. What does DRILSDOWN do?</h4>
      <p align="left">DRILSDOWN facilitates the 3 main steps to
        realizing the VisAD vision: <i>Select</i>, <i>Interact</i>, <i>Capture</i>.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Select space-time regions
        ("cases") where results from a candidate algorithm look
        "interesting" enough to merit a "drilling down".<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Interact with GUI (tied to a Notebook) to
        examine the algorithm's results and intermediate steps in light
        of raw data underlays. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Capture findings, and templates for
        repeating the process (identically on other data cases, or in a
        next round of refinements).<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 align="left">4. How are those three steps (<i>select, interact,
          capture</i>) represented in software? <br>
      </h4>
      <p align="left"><b>St</b><b>ep 1</b> (<i>select</i>) is often
        rooted in a user's own candidate codes, which define
        "interesting" cases. A case consists of a space and time range
        (bounding box) and a label. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Step 2</b> (<i>interact</i>) requires an IDV
        bundle with data and candidate algorithms ready to execute on
        them. Preparing this initial bundle is part of Step 3, since the
        cycle must be primed with an initial case study. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Step 3</b> (<i>capture</i>) encompassed several
        sub-activities. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">3a. IDV bundles are captured to seed Step 2, for
        repeating on other cases, or for the next round of refinement. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">3b. Notebooks with case metadata, candidate
        algorithm information, computation calls, and screen captures
        from the interactions in Step 2 are captured as a scientific
        record. These <i>case study notebooks</i> can be published to a
        RAMADDA repository as a coherent set of JuPyter and IDV files,
        where they are viewable and downloadable as a replicable
        scientific experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">3c. A notebook like 3b. can be stripped down to
        its basics and captured as a seed, for repeating identically on
        other cases, of for the next round of refinement. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Each of these captured items has associated
        services, so Step 3 is a big composite item. <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 align="left">4. Is DRILSDOWN one thing, or several? <br>
      </h4>
      <p align="left">Based on the above, DRILSDOWN must be at least 3
        things! It is better to view DRILSDOWN as <b>a set of
          connectors</b> that link JuPyter notebooks (used for steps 1
        and 3), The IDV (for step 2), and an IDV-related
        repository-with-services called RAMADDA (for step 3). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">These connectors include internal enhancements and
        plugins to The IDV and RAMADDA software packages, plus a
        drilsdown.py file and/or Jython shell for JuPyter that bring
        capabilities into the JuPyter notebook environment.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><i>Select</i> (step 1) often consists of users'
        own candidate codes, which define "interesting" cases. For this
        reason, our development focuses on designing an interface for
        users to interact with step 2 (the core IDV GUI process). Our
        own scientific use cases are offered as models. <br>
        <br>
      </p>

          frustrate or disappoint the potential user base with premature
          releases that don't actually serve top-level VisAD goals.
          However, test versions that embody workflows from our
          atmosphere and ocean research are available. Volunteer "alpha
          testers" to extend and generalize these use cases will be
          recruited when a critical mass of functionality has been
          assembled and tested.<br>
